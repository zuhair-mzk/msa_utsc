        <p className="section-description">
          The Muslim students association at the University of Toronto,
          Scarborough is a club that has been active for over 12 years now and is
          one that promotes unity in diversity. Our mission is to promote and
          create an environment of peace and harmony. We strive to provide safe
          spaces for the Muslim and non-Muslim community on campus so that we may
          gather together, learn together, and grow together.
        </p>
        <p className="section-description">
          We wish to offer assistance and support to the best of our abilities to
          Muslim students as well as to those who are curious about Islam. We are
          committed to serve our community.

        <p className="section-description">
          Our core values centre around peace, empathy, compassion, and religious
          harmony. The MSA values honest work and believes in taking ownership and
          accountability for oneâ€™s actions. We do our best to uphold those values
          from the executive team all the way down to the newest members.
        </p>
        <p className="section-description">
          We want to encourage everyone on-campus and in the broader community,
          muslims and non-muslims alike, to practice peace, empathy and
          understanding in all aspects of life.
